### Picture 1

1. Gamma normalization is better than standard normalization.
2. For L1 normalization, MOST_FRAC_INDEX performs similarly to RANDOM_INDEX. For LInf normalization, RANDOM_INDEX is better than MOST_FRAC_INDEX.

### Picture 2

Of course, add all Benders cuts > tight Benders cuts > no Benders cut.
1. Based on LInf normalization and MOST_FRAC_INDEX, there appears to be no difference between the six settings, which is unfavorable.
2. Based on L1 normalization, the results are similar and positive.

### Table

1. 1 hour is not an optimal choice. The solving time for the subproblem increases significantly.
2. There is no guarantee that split Benders is always better than standard Benders, even when the number of facilities exceeds 500.

### Thoughts

1. The key point is the Benders cuts found when solving the DCGLP. Adding one or two split cuts at the beginning might be beneficial.
2. The example used is not suitable for testing. Consider changing to a more complex example.
